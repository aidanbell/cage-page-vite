## üí≠ The Concept:

The Cage Page is a silly idea that has grown more and more. 
The concept was simple to begin with:
- A group of friends and I wanted to watch all of the worst movies
staring `Nic Cage`
- These movies were occasionally unbearable, so we were force to drink heavily
- There was no established drinking games for any of these movies, since a good deal of them never saw the flicker of a movie theatre projector

## ‚òëÔ∏è The Features:
- Users should log in using Google Auth to begin the experience
- Users will land at a dashboard of all of their watched `Cage` movies
- Users can browse a list of movies (which obviously only include `Nic Cage`)
- Clicking on a movie will show a details view, complete with plot, genres, and a user rating
- From the details page, users can add the movie to their 'watched' list (Sorry, there's no unseeing a `Cage` movie)
- Users can also add rules to each Cage movie, which will show up in a scrollable section beside the movie details
- If a rule was particularly good, users can "Toast" a rule, adding to a running counter

## üñºÔ∏è The Screens:
*Coming soon*

## üìã The Process:
- The app was initially built on the Express framework using Mongoose to connect to a MongoDB database. The app began to develop the need for a more advanced front-end, so a React SPA was added to the existing backend. With the file structure becoming bloated by legacy code and a new front-end, the two were separated for better organization, and ease of deployment. 
- The app authenticates users using OAuth2 and Passport. Current provider is limited to Google, but more may be added in the future. JSON Web Tokens are used to authenticate requests with the backend.

## üîÆ The Future:
In no order of priority, this is what I'm working to add to The Cage Page:
- ~~Index indexing:~~
  - ~~Sort by name, date, rules total, rating,~~ etc-
- Improved User Dashboard:
  - See engagement on rules
  - See total rules
- Rule reviews:
  - "this rule was too strong"
  - "this never happens"
  - etc
- What I'm working on:
  - ~~Transitioning to API calls from a SPA~~
  - Cleaning up Front-End
